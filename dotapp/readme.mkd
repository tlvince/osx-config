# dotapp

OS X application bundle wrappers, see <http://dotapp.github.io>.

Cloned as submodules within a directory in my `$HOME` and launched via Alfred
2; `mds`/Spotlight indexes the bundle, meaning they don't necessarily have to
be installed within `/Applications`. You can append `.noindex` to prevent this
behaviour.
